Instructions for compiling DFTB+ (TESTED ON 26/04/2024 on the EPFL SCITAS cluster)

$ git clone --branch release https://github.com/dftbplus/dftbplus.git 
$ #module load gcc openblas fftw intel-mkl cmake
$ cd dftbplus/

$ conda create -n dftb+ python=3.10.8
$ conda activate dftb+
$ conda install -c conda-forge gcc=8.5.0 gxx=8.5.0 cmake=3.26.1 blas 

NOTE: to enable modules such as D3 corrections or sockets, you can use the follwoing lines:
$ sed -i 's/WITH_SDFTD3 "Whether the s-dftd3 library should be included" FALSE/WITH_SDFTD3 "Whether the s-dftd3 library should be included" TRUE/g' config.cmake
$ sed -i 's/WITH_SOCKETS "Whether socket communication should be allowed for" FALSE/WITH_SOCKETS "Whether socket communication should be allowed for" TRUE/g' config.cmake
=> You can also directly change FALSE to TRUE in the config.cmake file by yourself !

$ FC=gfortran CC=gcc cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=opt/dftb+ -B _build
$ cmake --build _build -- -j 16
$ cmake --install _build

=> The dftb+ executable will be created in the following direction: opt/dftb+/bin
=> The best way to branch then your dftb+ executable is to link it with your bashrc:
$ PATH=$PATH:/The/Path/where/it/is
$ export PATH

NOTE: for python usage, you can also manually change the directory of your dftb+ executable within the ase calculator within your conda environment: "vi anaconda3/envs/name_of_your_env/lib/pythonXXX/site-packages/ase/calculators/dftb.py", then Line 20: command = ‘dftb+ > PREFIX.out’
