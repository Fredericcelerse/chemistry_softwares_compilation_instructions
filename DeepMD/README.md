### DeepMD compilation from yml files

You can install deepmd using already provided environments to build more efficiently your deepmd environment.
To do that with CPU you just have to type:
```
conda env create -y deepmd-cpu-environment.yml 
```
or if you want to use GPU
```
conda env create -y deepmd-gpu-environment.yml # FOR GPU
```

### DeepMD compilation from source

Instead, if you need to compile DeepMD directly from the source, you can use either the DeepMD-CPU or DeepMD-GPU files.
