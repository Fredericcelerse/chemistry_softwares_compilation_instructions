### Compilation rules for DeepMD



You can either compile deepmd from the source or using already provided environments to build more efficiently your deepmd environment.
To do that you just have to type:
```
conda env create -y deepmd-cpu-environment.yml # FOR CPU
```
or
```
conda env create -y deepmd-gpu-environment.yml # FOR GPU
```
